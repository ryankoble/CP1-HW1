Here is my description for my homework. This assignment was quite fun. I almost figured out the challenge, but I couldn't figure out how to make it produce new bubbles. I tried modifying the splice method, as well as trying out other array methods, but I couldn't figure it out. I was able to switch it to clicking outside of the bubbles however by switching the less than and greater than sign around.
