This assignment was quite fun. I almost figured out the challenge, but I couldn't figure out how to make it produce new bubbles. I tried modifying the splice method, as well as trying out other array methods. It says that the splice method can add items to an array, however I think those items need to be defined in the text preceding the splice method, but I was unsure about that. I was able to switch it to clicking outside of the bubbles however by switching the less than and greater than sign around, and then it instead would delete all of the bubbles when clicking outside of any bubbles.
